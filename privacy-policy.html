<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>As an avid privacy advocate, and lover of open source software, I tried to design Sporadic in a way that would respect the user's privacy. I want to build apps that I want to use. This privacy policy is written by me, Brendan Perry, and I am not a lawyer :).
</p>
<p>Sporadic uses a unique and private key associated with your iCloud account, provided by Apple, to associate data with you when you use the app. This key does not link to your personal identity. 
  
</p>

<p>This app does contain user generated content. Sporadic stores a "username" which can be whatever the user chooses. Groups and exercises also have custom names that can contain whatever information a user enters. All content is stored in an iCloud database.</p>

</p>
  
<p>Sporadic uses a service called OneSignal to provide push notifications. OneSignal does collect some data which can be found on their website: https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/apple-app-privacy-requirements. Sporadic uses OneSignal to the minimum degree required to send you push notifications.</p>

<p>You data is not sold, and your identity is not known (so long as you don't put your full legal name as your username, that is on you!).</p>
